# Nessus-Vulnerability-Management

## Objective

My client (pretend) has asked for a vulnerability scan on their machine to detect any security weaknesses, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities that might be exploited by malicious actors. This scan will help identify potential risks and ensure the system's defenses are robust against possible threats. 

### Skills Learned

- Nessus installation and set up
- Identifying all the different scanning options and deciding on which to use
- Locating the various vulnerabilities
- Gain the ability to evaluate the severity of identified vulnerabilities, recognizing which issues present the greatest risks
- Insight into common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs), their implications
- Learn to prioritize vulnerabilities by assessing risk, taking into account factors such as ease of exploitation, potential impact, and the criticality of the affected system
- To offer actionable remediation strategies tailored to identified vulnerabilities, including measures like applying patches, adjusting configurations, or updating software
